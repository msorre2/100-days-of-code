# 100 Days of Code Challenge
## *I will code for an hour each day over the next 100 days*

### Start Date
November 26, 2017

## Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge. (If you've just started learning to code, read [FAQ](FAQ.md))
6. I will add a link to each post [log](log.md).
